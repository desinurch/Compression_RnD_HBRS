    \chapter{Conclusions}
    Based on the results obtained, sparsity of the network affect negatively to latency. There is also a trade-off for accuracy and latency, where the lower the latency is tolerated, the lower accuracy of neural network will be. Sparsity of the network also affects latency by prolonging the latency itself.

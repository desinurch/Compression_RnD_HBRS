# Master's Thesis Latex Template [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mas-group/project-report.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mas-group/project-report)

This template is designed for the R&D and master's thesis reports of the Autonomous Systems master's program at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. Based on the template created by Ronni Hartanto in 2003.

The template is configured to be printed two-sided by default; this can be changed to a supervisor's preference by passing the option `oneside` instead.

The logo of an external institution can be added with the command `\thirdpartylogo{path/to/image/}`


## Usage
The main file of the report is `report.tex`; chapters, appendices, and the abstract are given in separate files in the `chapters` directory.

When submitting a report, the name of the pdf should be changed to match the naming convention specified in the MAS wiki, namely

```
LastNameI-[RnD-MT]Report
```

Examples: For an R&D, John Doe would name his file `DoeJ-RnDReport.pdf`; for a thesis, John Doe would name the file `DoeJ-MTReport.pdf`.
